(By-Laws made in accordance with section 2.2)<br />

1.1.1 	To foster an appreciation of speculative fiction, fantasy, horror and fan works.</p>
<p><a name="regulations2"><br />
<h3>2 	ADDITIONAL TYPES OF MEMBERSHIP</h3>

<p><a name="regulations3"><br />
<h3>3 	SPECIFIFIED METHOD OF OPTIONAL PREFERENCIAL VOTING</h3>
<p></a><br />
(By-Laws made in accordance with section 6.5)<br />
3.1 	The voter indicates preferences for candidates by using the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc.<br />
3.2 	A quota is determined as follows: Quota = (Total number of formal votes Â¸ (Number to be elected + 1)) + 1 (disregarding any remainder).<br />
3.3 	Candidates receiving a number of first preference votes greater than or equal to a quota are declared elected. Any votes of these elected candidates, which are surplus to the quota, are transferred to the remaining candidates at a transfer value. If no candidate receives a number of first preference votes greater than or equal to a quota then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded from the count in accordance with paragraph 3.9 below.<br />
3.4 	The transfer value determined for the distribution of the surplus votes of a candidate elected from first preference votes is calculated as follows: Transfer Value = Number of elected candidate's surplus votes (i.e. those in excess of quota) Â¸ Number of first preference votes received (i.e. the number of ballot papers)<br />
3.5 	The ballot papers of each elected candidate are re-examined (commencing with the candidate with the largest surplus) and the total number of second or next available preferences for each non-elected candidate is multiplied by that elected candidate's transfer value. The resultant numbers are in each case the number of votes, which are credited to the relevant non-elected candidate.<br />
3.6 	Whenever, as a result of the distribution of an elected candidate's surplus votes, a candidate obtains a total equal to or greater than the quota, that candidate is the next elected.<br />
3.7	The transfer value determined for the distribution of surplus votes of a candidate elected following a transfer is calculated as follows: Transfer Value = Last Transfer Value x Value of candidate's surplus votes Â¸ Total value of candidate's votes.<br />
3.8 	All of those ballot papers are re-examined. The votes of the elected candidate are transferred to the remaining candidates at the new transfer value according to the next preference on the ballot paper.<br />
3.9 	Where, after the distribution of all elected candidates' surplus votes has been completed, no other candidate has obtained a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota, the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded from the count. All of the ballot papers held by an excluded candidate are then distributed to the candidates remaining in the count (i.e. all non-elected candidates who have not been excluded) according to the next available preference expressed on those ballot papers. These ballot papers are transferred at the transfer value they had at the time of transfer from the excluded candidate.<br />
3.10 	Similar exclusions are carried out until a candidate eventually obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota, and is, as a consequence, elected.<br />
3.11 	The surplus votes of any candidate elected as a result of the transfer of votes from an excluded candidate are dealt with in accordance with paragraphs 3.7 and 3.8 above.<br />
3.12 	The process of distributing surpluses and excluding candidates continues as necessary, until either the number of candidates to be elected is elected or all candidates except the number to be elected have been excluded. In the latter case, non-excluded candidates not already elected are declared elected.<br />
3.13 	Where, at any stage in the count, a ballot paper contains no preference for any one candidate remaining in the count, then that ballot paper is deemed exhausted and is set aside as being finally dealt with.</p>

In this circumstance the CSC may stay the committee memberâs dismissal pending the outcome of a possible dismissal of the Convenor.]  In the case of misconduct the WASFF Chairperson, Treasurer or Administrator may suspend or dismiss an ordinary committee member.<br />
4.23.8 	In the event of misconduct, underperformance, disruption, or other sufficient reason, the Convenor may recommend to the CSC dismissal of an executive committee member (other than Convenor).  The CSC shall consider and may dismiss the executive committee member (other than Convenor) under this rule.  The CSC may consider dismissal of an executive committee member other than the convenor on its own volition and this consideration shall include consultation with the Convenor.  The CSC may dismiss the executive committee member if appropriate.  [Note: Should the CSC not consider it appropriate to dismiss the executive committee member, the ongoing effective working of the organising committee should be considered and the CSC should consider whether it maintains confidence in the Convenor.]  In the case of misconduct the Convenor, WASFF Chairperson, Treasurer or Administrator may suspend an executive committee member pending consideration of dismissal.<br />
4.23.9 	In the event of misconduct, underperformance, no confidence, or other sufficient reason, the CSC may consider dismissal of the Convenor after consultation between the Convenor and the Chair of the CSC.  Said consultation is to communicate concerns/deficiencies, required outcomes and deadlines for a satisfactory resolution, otherwise the question of dismissal of the Convenor may be put to the CSC for consideration.  In the event of misconduct the CSC may consider dismissal immediately without said consultation.  Such a question must be passed by at least 4 CSC members.  An appeal of the decision of the CSC to dismiss the Convenor may be made to the board of WASFF.<br />
4.23.10	A decision to dismiss an organising committee member other than the Convenor has no automatic right of appeal to the board.  However the board may of its own volition consider this question and make an ultimate determination.<br />
4.23.11 When considering dismissal of a committee member, the principles of natural justice should be considered and decision making should be transparent, where possible, however the overriding considerations are: the delivery of a convention, the functionality of the committee, the leadership role of the Convenor, working towards and within the long term plans of the CSC, the maintenance of the good reputation of Swancon and WASFF, and compliance with the Constitution and By-laws of WASFF.</p>

9.3.2 	Teen WARSFC Attendee<br />
9.3.2.1 People of age 12 to 17 years may attend the WARSFC if the approved fee is paid and consent of a responsible adult is given in writing. Teen attendees do not have voting rights, except with regard to awards, but may attend and observe the AGM. Teen Attendees details are confidential, are not permitted to be released and are exempt from section 14 of the constitution as they are not members of WASFF. The adult responsible for the Teen Attendee must agree to be ultimately responsible for the conduct of the Teen Attendee. Teen Attendees may be excluded from certain events that are not age appropriate. The adult responsible for a Teen Attendee under the age of 15 must be a member of the convention. A Teen Attendee aged 15 or more does not require their responsible adult to be a member of the convention.<br />
9.3.3 	Child WARSFC Attendee<br />

CIT Attendees may be excluded from certain events that are not age appropriate, but may otherwise attend the WARSFC where Child Attendees are not provided for and age appropriate programming is not provided, subject to normal reasonable behaviour requirements. CIT Attendees who are not Child Attendees may be excluded from parts of the WARSFC where Child Attendees are provided for and age appropriate program content is provided. In other words where there is an age appropriate item programmed and a Child Attendee fee is charged, then being a CIT Attendee does not circumvent the need to pay the fee to participate in the programmed item. Where these programmed item is not age appropriate the CIT attendee need not have the fee pay to attend. The organising committee of the WARSFC may provide facilities for CIT Attendees.<br />
9.3.5 	A person that is not yet 18, but turns 18 before or on the first day of the WARSFC may purchase a provisional membership, that is not active until the person turns 18.

Such a preliminary acceptance is subject to review and reversal prior to the next AGM by a majority of 5 members of the board for any of the following reasons only:<br />
a) A person may be refused membership by a resolution of an absolute majority of members of the board on the same grounds that a person can be expelled. Membership may not be refused on this ground merely because a prospective member's conduct might be detrimental to the objectives of WASFF at some point in the future;<br />
b) Membership may be refused if Â¾ (rounded up) of Board members sign a document citing that they believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a prospective member's conduct will be detrimental to the objectives of WASFF; or<br />

a) An existing member seeking renewal may be denied renewal by a resolution of an absolute majority of members of the board on the same grounds that a person can be expelled. Renewal may not be refused on this ground merely because a member's conduct might be detrimental to the objectives of WASFF at some point in the future;<br />
b) Renewal of membership may be refused if Â¾ (rounded up) of Board members sign a document citing that they believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the member's conduct will be detrimental to the objectives of WASFF;<br />
c) A person may be refused renewal of membership if they are found by an absolute majority of board members to have caused serious mental or physical harm to a member of WASFF; or<br />
d) The person has been expelled.<br />

<h2>PART3 - BY-LAWS MADE BY THE BOARD</h2>
<p></a><br />
(By-Laws made in accordance with section 13.4)</p>
<p>8.	The Board delegates the ability to approve expenditure as per Regulation 5.5 of any amount up to $500 to the Chairman and the Treasurer where a subcommittee requires approval within 48 hours.  Such approval shall be reported to the next Board meeting.<br />
9.	Further to regulation 5.6, accounts, other that sub-committee accounts, shall have the Treasurer, Chairman and Administrator as signatories.  If a change of signatory is required, it should be done as soon as practicable, but not later than 3 months.  In the intervening time, if the retiring signatory is a member of the board they may sign a cheque if written authority to do so is provided by the incoming signatory.  In the event that the retiring signatory is no longer a member of the board then that signatory may not act as a signatory, unless authorised to do so by the board.<br />
10.	Further to regulation 5.6, sub-committee accounts may have 2 or more signatories from the sub-committee as signatories as nominated by the sub-committee and approved by the Board.  The at least two board signatories shall include the Treasurer and the Chairman.<br />
11.	Further to regulation 5.7, the amount determined by the board is $7,000.  It is intended that this amount be updated each year, using regulation 5.7 as a guide.<br />
12.	Further to regulation 5.8, the amount determined by the board is $2,000.  It is intended that this amount be updated each year, using regulation 5.8 as a guide.<br />
13.	Further to regulation 5.10, the amount determined by the board is $3,000.  It is intended that this amount be updated each year, using regulation 5.10 as a guide.<br />
14.	Further to regulation 5.11, the amount determined by the board is $10,000.  It is intended that this amount be updated each year, using regulation 5.11 as a guide.<br />
15.	The board may give advance approval of expenditures under regulation 5.5 in the form of budget approval, where the budget specifies with sufficient detail the item for which expenditure is proposed.<br />
16.	The board shall consider approval of a contract under regulation 5.9, other that a simple contract of purchase approved in a budget, as separate consideration to any budgetary considerations.  This is primarily to consider the full terms of the contract over and above any monetary amounts.<br />
17.	For purposes of By-Law 3.4, notification of WASFF general meetings shall be send to an electronic mailing list comprising the collected e-mail addresses of the two immediately preceding Swancons or, if that list is unavailable, the Swancon mailing list; and shall be displayed on the WASFF website and the current Swancon website.<br />
18.	Children attending WASFF events under the age of 12 must be remain under the direct care of a responsible adult member.<br />
19.	Member behaviour at WASFF events shall not be aggressive, offensive or harassing.  Such behaviour is not to be tolerated.  If a memberâs behaviour is inappropriate then it is preferable to indicate to the person that their behaviour is inappropriate.  If the behaviour is extremely inappropriate or the inappropriate behaviour continues despite a warning, the convener of the convention organizing committee, or a board member may exclude the member.  Such an exclusion may be for up to a day.  The member shall comply with such an exclusion and leave the site of the event.  There shall be no right of appeal, but the executive of the Board shall be informed of an exclusion as soon as possible and the Board may overrule the decision of it own volition.  Such behaviour requiring exclusion may be referred to the board for consideration of expulsion or ineligibility to renew their membership.<br />
20.	Certain items may be inherently dangerous, such as for example martial arts displays etc.  These items shall be listed as such in the programme and shall have a notice at the entry to the relevant room.  Members assume the risk of attending these events and agree not hold WASFF liable or any damage or injury not covered by insurance. If a member undertakes or contributes to any stupid, dangerous or risky activities then to the extent possible under the law the member waives any rights have against WASFF and shall indemnify WASFF for any injury or damage caused.<br />
21.	The organising committee of a WASFF event shall make reasonable endeavours to protect the well being of attendees of events.<br />
22.	Years in which a person attended WARSFC as a Member, Teen Attendee or Child Attendee are counted for the recognition of number of attendances of the WARSFC. Other years of attendance, such as years as a Child In Tow, Panelist, or Dealer, may be additionally counted; determination of this is by the consideration of the Board.<br />
23.	Core committee positions for the WARSFC organising committee, as noted in Regulations 4.21, include: the Convenor, Treasurer, Secretary, Guest Liaison, Venue Liaison, Program Co-ordinator and Marketing Co-ordinator.<br />
24.	Decision Making within Convention Organising Committee<br />

24.2	By default the decision making process is as follows:<br />
