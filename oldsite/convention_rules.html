        <div class="content"><p>Members must obey the following rules when attending events organised by a subcommittee of the Western Australian Science Fiction Foundation Inc. (WASFF):</p>
<p>Wear your badge at all times when within the convention area. Wearing your badge when elsewhere in the convention hotel is desirable.</p>
<p>If it is illegal outside the convention, it is illegal inside the convention, and may also be considered a breach of the convention rules. Illegal activity within the convention venue may also be considered a breach of the rules.</p>
<p>Member behaviour at WASFF events shall not be aggressive, offensive or harassing. Anyone whose behaviour disrupts the enjoyment of, invades the privacy of, or makes the environment unsafe for other attendees, or disrupts the running of the event, may be asked to moderate their behaviour or leave the event, by venue staff, committee members and WASFF board members.</p>
<p>When in the common space of the convention venue, you should dress appropriately for a public, child friendly, event. Separate events within the convention may have their own costume rules, that may relax this requirement with the approval of the convention committee.</p>
<p>Children remain the responsibility of a responsible adult member of the convention. Children under the age of 12 must remain under the direct care of a responsible adult. Events within the convention may be designated 'adults only' or otherwise age restricted, and individual program items may make other rules based on participant age, and it is the responsibility of the responsible adult member to be aware of these rules and ensure that they are abided by.</p>
<p>The convention venue may set any additional rules for use of the venue. Convention members must respect any requests made by the convention venue, and entry to the convention venue is subject to venue staff assent. Typically, venue requirements will prohibit sleeping in public areas of the convention, and may prohibit bringing any outside food to dining areas.</p>
<p>Convention venue staff may determine appropriate dress for public areas of the convention, including footwear. Most venues will require attendees wear approptiate footwear within the convention area.</p>
<p>Weapons or replica weapons are not permitted unless authorised by the committee. The committee may set any conditions on wearing or display that they feel appropriate. These conditions will typically include peace binding where appropriate.</p>
<p>Merchandise is only to be sold in designated dealers areas. The Swancon committee may make the decision that any merchandise is inappropriate for sale or display within the convention area. This may include, but is not limited to, copyright infringing and pornographic material.</p>
<p>Photography is permitted in public assemblies (more than 6 people), unless directed otherwise by a committee member. Photographers must obtain the permission of individuals or small groups (6 or less people) to photograph them.</p>
<p>Obey legitimate directions of venue staff, committee members and WASFF board members.</p>
<p>Breaches of the rules may result in refusal of membership, revocation of membership, expulsion from the convention, or expulsion from WASFF.</p>
<p>Please also see the <a href="values.html">WASFF Values</a>.</p>
