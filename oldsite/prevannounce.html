<h2>A Statement from the Board of WASFF</h2>
<p>The Board of the Western Australian Science Fiction Foundation Inc. ('WASFF') is aware of community concern regarding the safety of its members at its events.</p>
<p>The Board is actively working on measures to ensure every SwanCon attendee can expect to enjoy a safe experience at the 2010 and future conventions. This includes putting in place policies and mechanisms to deal with current concerns and future contingencies.</p>
<p>We are following the directions given by our members at the 2009 AGM, and are actively encouraging community input into actions such as a statement of values and expanding membership by-laws. These actions will improve the ability of the Board to act appropriately on incidents of concern. There is a mandated consultation period in implementing these relevant changes to our by-laws.</p>
<p>We ask for some community understanding on the time it has taken and will take to achieve these. WASFF is an incorporated body. This ensures that events such as SwanCon can be organised effectively. It also means that the Board is bound by the laws of Western Australia and has to consider these when making decisions and changes to these by-laws. This does not always allow the Board to make decisions within the fastest timeframe.</p>
<p>The Board would like to make the following points clear.</p>
<p>We aim for all WASFF events to be places where all of our members may enjoy themselves safely. We would like all members to consider the way they act at our events and be aware of not just their rights but the rights of the other attendees. We expect decent respectful behaviour. Antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated. Members are reminded that WASFF events may be open to public participation and members are expected to behave appropriately and according to the law.</p>
<p>Antisocial behaviour may result in expulsion from the event, exclusion from all WASFF events and legal repercussions.</p>
<p>The Board is especially proud of the achievement of SwanCon, its 35-year history, and does not view favourably any occasion where any past or present member acts in a manner that exposes WASFF to public ridicule or contempt or otherwise prejudice the conduct of its activities or the satisfaction of its objectives.</p>
<p>If a member feels that they cannot attend an event and act in an appropriate responsible manner, we strongly suggest that member reconsider their attendance.</p>
<p>The WASFF Board.<br />
Doug Burbidge (Chair), Elaine Kemp (Treasurer), Russell B. Farr (Administrator), Jaunita Landéese (elected board member), Sarah Parker (elected board member), Julian Ackermann (elected board member), Paul Raj Khangure (Swancon 2009 representative), John Green (Swancon 2010 representative), Alisa Krasnostein (Swancon 2011 representative), Rohan Wallace (Immediate Past Chair).</p>

<p><a href="files/Convention&#32;Bid&#32;Form.doc">http://wasff.sf.org.au/files/Convention Bid Form.doc</a></p>
<p>Nominations for the 6 elected positions on the WASFF board must be<br />
received by the chair before the start of the meeting.</p>
<p>Please take note of the following new <a href="constitution.html">by-laws</a>:</p>
<p>27.1 Only Ordinary and Associate members may take core committee positions on a WARSFC organising committee.  Other persons may take non-core positions, but they are not be officers of WASFF and shall not be regarded as having any authority to act or speak on behalf of WASFF or the convention organising committee, unless doing so on behalf of a core position.  Core positions include: Convenor, Treasurer, Secretary, Guest Liaison, Venue Liaison and Program Co-ordinator.</p>
<p>27.2 Candidates for convention organising bids shall disclose to the AGM whether they have any criminal convictions and whether they have been bankrupt.</p>
<p>28.1 Candidates for board positions shall disclose to the AGM whether they have any criminal convictions and whether they have been bankrupt.</p>
<p>There are two motions on notice.  One is a motion to promote a set of by-laws adopted by the board concerning memberships and rules for refusing membership and/or renewal, to the status of regulations. They are attached.  The second is a proposal to restructure the WASFF board and to implement a Conventions Steering Committee, as a sub-committee of the board for planning for and co-ordination of<br />
Swancons.  This proposal is also attached.  (This is attached a second time as a set of marked up changes.)  We intend to suspend so much of standing orders to deal with the restructure before the election of board members and bid since the restructure affects this election and will change the way in which Swancons are organised.</p>
<p>If you wish to stand for a position on the board under one set of rules but not the other, please nominate before the meeting, and if necessary your nomination can be withdrawn.  Those bidding for the Swancon 37 2012 should also be mindful that if adopted, the restructure will change the manner of organisation of Swancons, with the proposed Steering Committee having a role in planning, co-ordination and approvals.</p>

<h2>WASFF Board Vacancies</h2>
<p>As you may know, due to the resignations of Tom Eitelhuber and Amanda Rainey there are currently two vacancies on the WASFF board.</p>
<p>I personally thank both Tom and Amanda for their service, both on the board and in other parts of our community.</p>
<p>But it means that there are two spots to fill on the WASFF board, and then one spot to fill on the Convention Steering Committee.</p>
<p>The ideal board should represent our community and all its diversity, so if there's a particular interest that you think is under-represented, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Anybody who is interested in one of those WASFF board spots, please send a short resumé to me or to wasff (at) sf.org.au.  Our next board meeting is next Sunday, July 1st, and we hope to appoint new board members at that meeting.</p>
<p>Once the board is topped up, we'll hold an election within the board to fill the Convention Steering Committee vacancy.</p>
<p>Of course, you can help us in other ways: volunteer at a con or before a con -- if you have skills you think would be relevant to programming, marketing, fundraising, awards, masquerade, art show, front desk, logistics, or anything else, or you'd like to learn, then we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>May 16th, 2014:</p>
<h2>Swancon 2016 Community Canvass</h2>
<p>As the WASFF 2014 AGM did not appoint a Swancon 2016 convention committee, the Board was directed to canvass the community and form a subcommittee to run Swancon 2016.</p>
<p>This is that canvass. Feel free to forward this to other parties who you think might be interested. </p>
<p>We will be accepting submissions from full or partial prospective committees, as well as submissions from individuals interested in one or more positions.</p>
<p>First, here are the details and bid form on our website, to let you know the bidding requirements:</p>
<p><a href="swanconbidding.html">http://wasff.sf.org.au/swanconbidding</a><br />
<a href="files/20140125&#32;Convention&#32;Bid&#32;Form.doc">http://wasff.sf.org.au/files/20140125%20Convention%20Bid%20Form.doc</a></p>
<p>Note that this form includes some of the legalese from the WASFF Constitution (<a href="constitution.html">http://wasff.sf.org.au/constitution</a>) -- things that you (if you are a successful committee member) will be committing to.</p>
<p>If you are a prospective convenor and you're submitting a bid that includes a complete or partial committee, please download this form, fill it in, and submit a copy to us electronically. You don't need to sign the copy you forward to us electronically -- we'll handle that at a later point in the process, as needed.</p>
<p>If you're an individual rather than part of a committee bid, you don't need to forward us the form, but you should be familiar with it.</p>
<p>There's a Wiki article on the positions and roles that previous convention committees have had, which may be of use to you:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.sf.org.au/Swancon_Committee_Positions">http://wiki.sf.org.au/Swancon_Committee_Positions</a></p>
<p>Prospective committees need not fill all of these positions.</p>
<p>Along with the form, please give us a text submission about you and/or your bid.  Here is what we'd like you to address in your submission:</p>
<p>* If you are a prospective convenor: your vision for Swancon 2016 (including theme, style, conceptual wish-list of guests and alignment with our values statement - <a href="values.html">http://wasff.sf.org.au/values</a>).</p>
<p>* If you are a prospective convenor and you're submitting a bid that includes a complete or partial committee, a list of the other people on your team.</p>
<p>* For all prospective committee members: the role(s) you are interested in, your Swancon experience, your community experience, your skills and life experience relevant to the role(s) you're interested in, and your expected workload over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>* For all prospective committee members: any challenges you may face which may need additional attention and support if successful.</p>
<p>* For all prospective committee members: a statement declaring whether you have any criminal convictions and whether you have been bankrupt (this does not disqualify you from running).</p>
<p>* For all prospective convenors or individual applicants: an email address and/or telephone number you can be contacted with.</p>
<p>* Any other relevant factors that you believe should be declared and/or that speak to the suitability of your submission.</p>
<p>Submissions are open now, and will close at 11:59pm AWST on Saturday the 31st of May, 2014. </p>
<p>Please submit via email to <a href="mailto:swancon-2016@swancon.com.au">swancon-2016@swancon.com.au</a></p>
<p>Following the submission closing date, the Convention Steering Committee will review submissions and make recommendations to the WASFF board.  (The CSC is made up of three WASFF Board members, the past, the present and [usually] the future convention convenors, and a couple of other interested parties as non-voting observers.)</p>
<p>The WASFF Board will arrange a date to meet short-listed applicants to discuss their submissions face to face.</p>
<p>The CSC and the Board will then jointly make a decision, notify the successful and unsuccessful applicants, and then notify the community.</p>
<p>The successful convenor will also be provided with the names and contact details of anyone who applied individually, to consider for their committee.</p>
<p>We hope to complete this process by mid to late June.</p>
<p>Any questions or requests for clarifications about this process or the submission requirements can also be emailed to <a href="mailto:swancon-2016@swancon.com.au">swancon-2016@swancon.com.au</a></p>
<p>Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favour! :)</p>

<h2>Swancon 2016 Convention Organising Committee Appointed</h2>
<p>The WA Science Fiction Foundation (WASFF) Convention Steering Committee (CSC) is pleased to announce that an organising committee for Swancon 41 (to be held in 2016) has been appointed.</p>
<p>Following a community canvass and call for submissions, the CSC evaluated responses and made recommendations to the WASFF Board which then met to review the responses and appoint a bid.</p>
<p>The Swancon 2016 organising committee is convened by Isobel White, with Evan Beasley as Secretary, Jack Bridges as Treasurer, Sarah Parker as Marketing Coordinator, and Lyndon "Frames" White as Programme Coordinator in addition to a number of other committee members in varying positions.</p>
<p>The theme for Swancon 2016 will be Modern Speculative Fiction and Contemporary Fantasy, and will likely be held over Easter (March 24th - 28th) 2016.</p>
<p>The WASFF Board and CSC congratulate Isobel on her committee's proposal, and look forward to working with her and her committee over the coming years.</p>
